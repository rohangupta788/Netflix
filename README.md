# Netflix
I recently created this Netflix UI clone application project. It fetches the movie data from a third-party API. It also has trailer pop-ups functionality implemented into it. The clone has been built using React JS, React-hooks, Styled-component, Material-UI, TMDB API.


## Steps Include :
-Getting TMDB API Key
-Creating REACT App 
-Getting all movies & building the Netflix movie rows
-Building the banner of the app
-Building the NAVBAR!
-Adding firebase hosting to your app
-Adding Netflix Movie Trailer POP-UPS!
-Deploying Your App to Firebase & Host it online
